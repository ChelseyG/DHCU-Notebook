# Lecture 3

## Housekeeping:
* professinal development courses; have to tell us what it's about
* Nothing yet for the next week
* Annotations are going well 
* Open notebook: used for eventual textbook and it helps the person giving the seminar and opportunity to use that material

## Text Analysis
### What is text
* "The wording of anything written or printed; the structure formed by the words in their order; the very words, phrases, and sentences as written". (OED)
* Words, novels, languages, etc. 
* Does it include visuals? 
  * Data: books, magazines, websites, newspapers, articles, emails, tweets, music etc.  

### What is text analysis
* Text analysis is a technological tool that allows for information to be apprehended from large amounts  of data as a means to track patterns and trends. 
* not necessarily technological - close reading
* too static to incorporate, it doesn't need to be done one way
* seeing how they take the data and use it do make a claim
* drawing conclusion, compare
* whether or not technology is essential 
* defined universe or sample that can be used to identify data and trends and track them - moves beyond what humans are able to see at times
* "webs of meaning" CLifford Geertz

1. Text analysis is a process that allows for information to be apprehended from data as means to track, identify, and compare patterns and trends to work towards a conclusion. 

* the deinition is complexe and we might not get a complete definition 

### Discilinary fears
* Close reading vs distant reading
* Focuses on a small amount of text, often does the work that a computer cannot, possibly more subjective, deeper comprehension of language
* Focuses on a large amount of text, often does the work that a human cannot, possibly more objective, semantaic comprehension of language
* anxiety of change - "will I lose my job?"
