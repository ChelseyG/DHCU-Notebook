# Lecture 3

## Housekeeping:
* professinal development courses; have to tell us what it's about
* Nothing yet for the next week
* Annotations are going well 
* Open notebook: used for eventual textbook and it helps the person giving the seminar and opportunity to use that material
* start pulling things together for the project in DX slack
* Use the notebook to make sense of your notes and your colleagues' notes

## Text Analysis
### What is text
* "The wording of anything written or printed; the structure formed by the words in their order; the very words, phrases, and sentences as written". (OED)
* Words, novels, languages, etc. 
* Does it include visuals? 
  * Data: books, magazines, websites, newspapers, articles, emails, tweets, music etc.  

### What is text analysis
* Text analysis is a technological tool that allows for information to be apprehended from large amounts  of data as a means to track patterns and trends. 
* not necessarily technological - close reading
* too static to incorporate, it doesn't need to be done one way
* seeing how they take the data and use it do make a claim
* drawing conclusion, compare
* whether or not technology is essential 
* defined universe or sample that can be used to identify data and trends and track them - moves beyond what humans are able to see at times
* "webs of meaning" CLifford Geertz

1. Text analysis is a process that allows for information to be apprehended from data as means to track, identify, and compare patterns and trends to work towards a conclusion. 

* the definition is complexe and we might not get a complete definition 

### Discilinary fears
* Close reading vs distant reading
* Focuses on a small amount of text, often does the work that a computer cannot, possibly more subjective, deeper comprehension of language
* Focuses on a large amount of text, often does the work that a human cannot, possibly more objective, semantaic comprehension of language
* anxiety of change - "will I lose my job?"

### Text Analysis activity
* What is it about: opiod crisis 
* What fatures did you notice: 
* 10 most commonly used works 
* number of times they show up: said (11), users (8), drug (7), health (7),drugs (5), opioid (5), ottawa (5), turnbull (5), city (city), month (4) 
* We do get some context and content for words, it is a list of random words, it needs context

### Tools 
* Word cloud - most commonly used
* sentiment data - context is important; used to sell products to people
* AntConc - free; different results based on different things you want to analyze
* all tools have own uses and limitations; choose based on what you are studying
* Collocates of data - in opposition
* Corpus - word clouds, frequencies, etc. more pink a word is the more it's used

### Summary
* Look at data from large body of text 
* Conclusions that we wouldn't get just  on our own
* chose the one that works with your research

## Mining the Dispatch - Roger Nelson 
* Mining a newspaper
* problem of indexing - idea of topic modelling 
* in January want ands spiked - get interesting patterns 
* fashion in analytical tools, topic modelling has fallen out of fashion at the moment because it hasn' been used to move the conversation forward in a long time
* Don't let the technology drive 
* It is cool though when you have a body of evidence 
* the machine is looking at each word in relationship with every other word in document and also in that entire corpus
* you choose the number of buckets
* need to know how many buckets you are looking at
* graeworks.net
* see inflexion, changes = generational turnover
* reading all these documents but in colours
* words about health and society 
* see how the topics sort themselves out
* topics=buckets; not a phrase but list of words
* model - something to understand what's going on; tool to think with 

Tools:
* R studio 
  * install tidy text then install tidyverse
* voyant tools
* find tools that work for you and will help you
