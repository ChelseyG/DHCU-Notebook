User and insightful aspects/approach

What is digital humanities?
* Magic?
* Can't ask questions?
* It does not explain anything

Borrowing from other disciplines and applying it to our field of study

## The problem of historians
* We are either facing future of scarcity or of abundance
  * could put it all online and it may be completely irrelevant
  * could solve problem of shifting material across formats and storage
  * If Net neutrality is put in place we will be facing a future of scarcity



## My data are this big
 * Metadata - through decoding it is the product of political choices at the time
  * Voices of other communities not only get ignored, but never existed in the first place - if it's not digitized it didn't exist
 * Big data: black box idea
 * The Spectre of Cliometrics
  * Mass digitization (sensus data, economic data, etc.)
  * Enthusiasm for what it could tell us about the past
 * Big data gothic
  * emotional responses and sublimating the self
  * goal was to overwhelme the senses to annihilate 'Self'
 * Make sense of thousands of documents at a time vs what off-laoding meaning-making to an algorithm does to our sense of humanity
 
 
 
* the dangers of borrowing
* how topic models work(ish)
* fun things to do with this magical method
* where we go from here
