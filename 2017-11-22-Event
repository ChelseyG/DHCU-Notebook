User and insightful aspects/approach

What is digital humanities?
* Magic?
* Can't ask questions?
* It does not explain anything

Borrowing from other disciplines and applying it to our field of study

## The problem of historians
* We are either facing future of scarcity or of abundance
  * could put it all online and it may be completely irrelevant
  * could solve problem of shifting material across formats and storage
  * If Net neutrality is put in place we will be facing a future of scarcity



## My data are this big
 * Metadata - through decoding it is the product of political choices at the time
  * Voices of other communities not only get ignored, but never existed in the first place - if it's not digitized it didn't exist
 * Big data: black box idea
 * The Spectre of Cliometrics
  * Mass digitization (sensus data, economic data, etc.)
  * Enthusiasm for what it could tell us about the past
 * Big data gothic
  * emotional responses and sublimating the self
  * goal was to overwhelme the senses to annihilate 'Self'
 * Make sense of thousands of documents at a time vs what off-laoding meaning-making to an algorithm does to our sense of humanity
 * Know what the method does in order to understand what we are seeing
 * Treat the algorithm as neutral but we need to avoid that
  
# The dangers of borrowing
* The Critical Difference: Justification versus Discovery
* Using computation 
* Way of bridging what we find and the story we want to tell
* Majority want to do statistically grounded work, but not necessarily about the truth but about seeing things in new ways

# How topic models work(ish)
* For Discoveries, not for justification
* Different groups representing a different topic
* Decomposes the documents into the number of groups identified
* Voyant tools
* Probabolistic sampling
* Topic models works out of the context (for words like lead)
* Have a distribuion over words
* dostribution over topics
* we guess number of topics
* estimate the probabilities
* estimate the likelihood if it's a good topic or not
* Looking year after year you can see how things become part of the conversation or fall out of the conversation
* evolution of scholarship overtime
* graeworks.net
* How do you visualize a topic model? 
 * focus on those that are really strong
* Historians most often use topic models for data with a strong chronological elemetn to understand change over time, and to challenge periodization





* fun things to do with this magical method
* where we go from here
