# FWD 50: Realizing the potential of our digital future / Réaliser le potentiel de notre futur numérique
## November 2, 2017
Nancy Chahwan, Deputy Commissioner of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) spoke on Thursday November 2 about the ways the CRA has been implementing digitization to foster innovation and improve services for the public, as part of FWD 50, which is Canada's digital government conference. She touched on:

* The tools the agency is using for service modernization
*	The ways that digitizing processes has actually improved service turnaround time from 6 weeks to 24 hour
*	The implementation of agile framework into government project development instead of waterfall
*	The visions for programs and client services that the agency hopes to digitize in the future
*	The ways they hope to improve current processes like cyber security

Nancy’s talk, though not long, discusses the way the government “no longer just encourages innovation, [but is] expecting it”.
