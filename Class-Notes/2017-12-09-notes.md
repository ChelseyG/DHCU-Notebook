 # Mapping
 Question: How one space becomes informational 
 What is up and what is down
 Open street map:
  * community driven mapping site
  * local uses contribute and maintain maps
  * all user generated
  
  google maps
  * street names
  * bus stations
  * major street names
  * more you zoom in the more data you get
  * names of bodies of water
  * major buildings names
  * buildings are pink
  * grass is green
  * some have actual rooms showing
  * street view - close access, though limiting
  * you don't see the same on street view as you do from the top - outdated

  How does having information like broken tree add to the map?
  * narrative
  * experience of the space
  
 ## Defining mapping in the digitial humanities
  * colonialisme involved in maps 
  * North American technipoints
  * maps have power
  * pose a narrative or counter narrative
  * description or visualization of a concept - i.e. mapping a human body
  * relationships between things
  * who gets to be on the map? Who puts you on the map?
  * data and capta distinction
  * are maps always geographical
  * capta is active, data is given - recorde dobserved
  * process, algorithm, sequences of changes, transitions,
  * "Creating [or contributing to a digital]/computationally a process through by visualizing structured relationships between concepts or things [data or capta] as viewed through a variety of dimessions such as time, space, power, and use etc. that carries semiotic value"  

## Humanities
Humanists can go deeper
Fred Gibbs course
* Calls it deep mapping
* Yi-Fu Tan
 * Space and Place
* Tim Cresswell on Place
 * conccept of place as relating to the world
 * "distinction between an abstract realm of space and an experienced and felt world of place"
 * "placelessness and nonplace" 
 * shopping malls as a transitional place
 * the role of architecture in space
* Doreen Massey
 * constituted by mobility - people, commodity, ideals, animals
 * way intercepting flows knock together, overlap, etc. 
 * maps often kill what we're studying or becomes vibrant and alive again (interactivity)

## Tools
* mapwarper.net
* Miriam posner - palladio to learn more
* One column labelled place, geocoordinates, and under column latitude and longitude in decimal degrees separated by a decimal 
* xtina-r/daea - mapping

## Writing the Book
* good exercise
* enbodied GIS article
* For all topics represent many disciplines - case study
* put source files where they can be forked
* over the holidays write a draft of the topic
 * for those who haven't gone yet, at least a roadmap or key points
 * discuss the outline as well and get group feedback before writting the chapters
* annotate pressbook with hypothesis on what people have already written to get feedback 
* January 8th - minimum outline to first draft
* finalize primary and secondary topics
 * primary is what you are presenting on
 * secondary sign-up; shawn's github
* Shawn's writing code
