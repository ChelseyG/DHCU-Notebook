# Public Humanities
* public: audience, everyone, participants, general, stakeholder, multiple different types of public, community, institutions, 
* where do we sit as students? Academia, public facing, 
* critics
* different bubbles
* Public space 
* coordinated mass
* barrier free space
* colaborative
* engage in discourse
* connect with users
* patience
* different bases of knowledge
* hyperlink discussion to learn about something and come back
  * 1941 As we May Think - all the world's knowledge at your fingertipes - follow trail of reasoning back to it's sources
* Wiki does a lot of what we are putting up on the board
## Key Components of Existing Definitions
* localized definition; another layer which is more globalized - values, 
* does public humanities exist at those different scales?
## How does this relate to our overall discussion of the digital humanities
* digital: ino access, new communities, information overload, weaponsized, 
* Traditional: scarcity, barriers to reach audiences
* issues of copyright
* are the goals the same: no, because the audiences may change, what is true based on concensus not by fact
* opposition because a different demographic is now being engaged
  * hierarchies exist in both
## Challenges about Public Scholarly Discussions
* catch 22 in the readings we did - public facing, but criticed 
* white middled aged man vs others
* Dan Pett - British Museum; retweeting on Twitter, social media team at museum was flabergasted at the tweets and didn't know wha to do
* museum has role - here they said it was redundant
* retrict yourself - know that your experience isn't the universal one
* Sealioning - type of trolling
* values in public humanities discussions
## Challenges and Opportunities 
* animosiy on the internet - how to mitigate it
 * turn off comments
 * changing the forums of discussion
* want to make things accessible
* people behind algorithms - PTSD because of the awefullness that is written in comments sectiion
* values instiling 
* not the tools creating the problem, it's just amphlifying them
* Digital humanities does not necessarily mean public - but there are powerful reasons for wanting to do that

British Museum Online
* not as engaging
* photo masking - draw around object create mask to cut the background out and the algorithm focuss on the object
