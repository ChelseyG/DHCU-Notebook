# Computational Creativity

Let's define creativity:
* the ability to create
* expression through medium
* problem solving
* surprise
* innovation
* relating seemingly unrelatable things
* imagination
* modification/transformation
* work/challenging

Issues:
* quality and subjectivity
* pressure to be creative
* stereotypes 
* elitism
* social/cultural norms

How do we bring computational into creativity?
* what is doing the creative work
* enhancing human ability 
* core vaues as a discipline? Or tools? 
  * Tools change what we know
* Turn test, A.I. if you can't tell if it's human or machine, the machine is intelligent
* not breaking conventions
* can't separate the human from the computer
* Remixing vs mixing; Towards A Refined Humanities

Examples: 
* Elegy for a Dead World
* Walden, a Game
* Photobashing
* Casual Creator Games(issues surrounding the field)
* Imj - cell counts etc. same algorithm to overlay stills from films (Visualization); defermation/repurposing from one domain into another
