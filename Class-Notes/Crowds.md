# Crowds
* The digital space
  * Virutal space allows actors to meet in time, no physical co-present required
 * The presentation of the self
  * conveying something to an audience (i.e. facebook)
  * potential to maintain a degree of anonymity (i.e. twitter)
 * Community asan Overused Concept
  * Similar to Brubaker and Cooper's "Beyond Identity"
  * alternative concepts to community
  * crowds: less personal, do-pile, negative, mob mentality, situational, temporary, self-serving
  * community: personal, intentional engagement, common interest, self-identify, shared values, demographic,imposed at times
  * others: network, 
 * Traditional Community vs Digital community 
  * T-Limiations: geographical location
  * T-Affordance: face-to-face, emotional, expression, 
  * V-Limitations: non-humans, third actor (tech/platform), access, trolls, digital literacy 
  * V-Affordance: not limited by geography, also access, anonymity,
