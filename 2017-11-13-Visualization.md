#Visualization

In preparation for next class, please do the following:
##Exercises:
1. Go to https://chelseyg.github.io/ and, using hypothesis, annotate one word you would use to define *visualization* next to the title; please complete the exercise before doing the readings and have it complete before 11:59pm on Friday November 10th. 
2. Save 15-20 pictures that best represent yourself or your personality to your desktop to use for an in-class exercise. It helps if you have them all saved in one folder so you can easily copy and paste them all. 

##Readings:
1. [Digital Surrealism: Visualizing Walt Disney Animation Studios](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/1/000276/000276.html)
2. 2-3 of your choice unless specified at a later date
